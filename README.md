# GloomBlue
A simple Weather app created using React.JS that displays the weather information based on the inputted city name. It consumes data from OpenWeatherMap and uses `https://datahub.io/core/country-list` to convert country code based on 2 digit codes (ISO 3166-1) into their full name.

## Live Demo
[GloomBlue](https://gloom-blue-weather-app.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku
