# Simple React Weather App
A simple React app that displays the weather information based on the inputted city name. It consumes data from OpenWeatherMap and uses `https://datahub.io/core/country-list` to convert country code based on 2 digit codes (ISO 3166-1) into their full name.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to [repo](https://github.com/foreign-key/react-weather-app)
2. Clone locally using
   `$ git clone https://github.com/foreign-key/react-weather-app.git` or download ZIP file
3. Enjoy!

## Notes

+ To be able to run the app, an **API key** must be supplied from `https://openweathermap.org/`.
+ Currently, it just supports searching by city name.

## Future Updates
+ Integrate maps based on the geo coordinates fetched from the server
+ Make some changes on the UI
+ 7-day forecast
